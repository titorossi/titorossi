## Hello world.

My name is **Tito Ibsen Rossi** and I am currently a third year student at **Amsterdam University College**. This is my first readme for my profile and it will probably change many times after this as I develop my coding skills and as a person.

At my university I have taken courses such as **Data Structures & Algorithms** where I learnt how to create Stacks, Queues and other such things in the language C. I have also taken **Machine Learning** which taught me the basics of web scraping and cleaning data alongside using regression models to analyse data. I am currently undertaking an internship where I use **GROMACS** to undertake **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**, so far this has taught me how to use the ubuntu terminal more proficiently (alongside vi commands) as well as giving me a perspective on applying chemistry and environmental sciences (which I have thoroughly studied at university) in a programming context.

I currently building a website with my friend using Django and SQL. This website will give students an oppurtunity to give their thoughts and opinons on any course they have taken in the university which will allow future students to make a more educated decision in their future course decisions. I will submit a link with the website here when it has been created.

I also wish to make a few videogames. So in the near future I will be undertaking Unity courses as well as any other relevant courses before embarking on these new and interesting coding projects.

### I'm looking forward to making this readme actually interesting to read!
