## Hello world.

My name is **Tito Ibsen Rossi** and I am currently a third year student at **Amsterdam University College**. This is my first readme for my profile and it will probably change many times after this as I develop my coding skills and as a person.

At my university I have taken courses such as **Data Structures & Algorithms** where I learnt how to create Stacks, Queues and other such things in the language C. I have also taken **Machine Learning** which taught me the basics of web scraping and cleaning data alongside using regression models to analyse data. I am currently undertaking an internship where I use **GROMACS** to undertake **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**, so far this has taught me how to use the ubuntu terminal more proficiently (alongside vi commands) as well as giving me a perspective on applying chemistry and environmental sciences (which I have thoroughly studied at university) in a programming context.

I have some miniprojects in mind, including videogames.

### I'm looking forward to making this readme actually interesting to read!

Haha life gets in the way sometimes. Brb.
